# AgusRdz_TFS_TestCaseExportTool
This project was created to streamline tasks test by using Microsoft Test Manager, the idea was taken from a discontinued project ( thanks to Dipak Sarma for sharing your code) of some aspects were improved but lack of time I I have given him the right track . I hope you find it useful.

To use this tool needs the VS SDK for 2010-2012 versions of Visual Studio , in the higher versions need instaler the Nuget Microsoft.TeamFoundationServer.ExtendedClient instead.
